## Django Girls Blog - Web Application


In this repository it is possible to find all source code produced
during the studies about Django Web Framework through the tutorial
created for the Django Girls workshops.

The source code is not hundred per cent equal to that produced in 
the tutorial, because it goal is not properly to reproduce the code
but improve them after the project be concluded or during the studies.

Feel free to fork this repository to explore the approaches adopted here.
